# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

> **Building the future of AI: decentralized, efficient, and privacy-first**

**DIN** is a fully peer-to-peer Federated Learning protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains. We enable secure AI collaboration, decentralized model training, and privacy-preserving data monetization—all without centralized gatekeepers or data silos.

🏆 **Grant Recipient**: [Cosmos Institute](https://cosmos-institute.org/) | Austin, Texas & University of Oxford

## 🚀 Why DIN Matters

Today’s AI is dominated by centralized infrastructure and massive compute monopolies. DIN offers a new paradigm:

- 🔐 **On-Device Learning** – Your data never leaves your device  
- 🧠 **Efficient AI Foundations** – Lightweight, utility-driven models optimized for edge computing  
- 🌐 **Distributed Compute** – Fully decentralized compute network—no cloud dependency  
- 💰 **Fair Data Monetization** – Stablecoin rewards for private, secure participation  

**When we say *decentralized*, we mean enabling individuals and organizations to fully own and control their data—preserving privacy while contributing to global AI development.**

## ⚡ How It Works

### For Data Contributors
1. **Keep Your Data Local** – Raw data stays entirely on your device  
2. **Send Model Updates Only** – Share secure, encrypted learning updates  
3. **Earn Stablecoins** – Be fairly compensated for your data’s contribution  
4. **Access Decentralized AI Services** – Use rewards to access tools and insights without ever giving up your privacy

### For AI Developers
1. **Deploy Federated Learning Models** – Across millions of local devices and nodes  
2. **Build for Small Compute** – AI that runs efficiently on IoT devices, robotics, and smartphones  
3. **Integrate with Ethereum** – Easily deploy across L2s, rollups, and AVS frameworks  
4. **Scale Responsibly** – Access large, diverse datasets without centralized aggregation
