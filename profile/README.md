# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

> **Building the future of AI where data stays yours and intelligence is shared**

**DIN** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains. We enable secure AI collaboration, privacy-first agent training, and data monetization—all without centralized gatekeepers or data silos.

🏆 **Grant Recipient**: [Cosmos Institute](https://cosmos-institute.org/) | Austin, Texas & University of Oxford

## 🚀 Why DIN Matters

Traditional AI relies on centralized data, creating privacy risks and data monopolies. DIN changes that with:

- **🔐 Data Sovereignty**: Your data stays under your control — private and compliant.  
- **🤖 Open AI Development**: Train AI agents anywhere, no centralized infrastructure.  
- **💰 Fair Rewards**: Earn stablecoins by contributing data on your terms.

## ⚡ How It Works

### For Data Contributors
1. **Keep Your Data Local** - Raw data never leaves your device
2. **Share Model Updates** - Only encrypted learning updates are transmitted
3. **Earn Rewards** - Receive stablecoin payments for contributions
4. **Access Premium Services** - Use earnings for advanced AI agent features

### For AI Developers
1. **Deploy Federated Learning** - Train models across distributed data
2. **Leverage Decentralized Compute** - No need for centralized servers
3. **Build Open Agents** - Create autonomous AI with built-in privacy
4. **Scale Globally** - Access diverse datasets without data movement

## 🛠️ Technical Foundation

### Decentralized Infrastructure
- **Validator Network**: Secured by Proof of Stake consensus
- **Eigenlayer Integration**: Bootstraps security using Ethereum's restaking infrastructure
- **Chain Agnostic**: Deploy across any Ethereum L2, rollup, or sidechain

### Economic Model
- **Stablecoin Transactions**: Predictable costs, no speculation
- **High-Frequency Rewards**: Transparent, trustless compensation
- **Circular Economy**: Earn by contributing, spend on premium services

### Privacy & Security
- **Federated Learning**: Train AI without exposing raw data
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Verify contributions without revealing data
- **Self-Sovereign Architecture**: No central authority controls your information

## 🏛️ Governance & Foundation

DIN operates as a **truly decentralized protocol** — no single entity controls the network. Like **Ethereum** and **EigenLayer**, DIN maintains **credible neutrality**, sustained by a global community and secured by decentralized validators.

The **DIN Foundation**, a non-profit entity, supports the protocol’s long-term evolution through open governance, funding public goods, and promoting self-sovereign AI ecosystems.
