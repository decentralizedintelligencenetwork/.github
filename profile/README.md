# Welcome to Doctelligence 🚀

*Doctelligence* is an organization built on the foundation of **[DIN: Decentralized Intelligence Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461)**.

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**, the core of Doctelligence, enables decentralized AI training using underutilized data sources. _DIN_ creates an accessible AI ecosystem that addresses data privacy and accessibility, allowing users to control and monetize their data while earning rewards for contributing to AI training.

## What We Do at *Doctelligence*:

At *Doctelligence*, we combine decentralized data stores, blockchain, federated learning, and privacy-preserving technologies to enhance AI development. _DIN_ enables data owners, including individuals, SMEs, and enterprises, and those using decentralized data storage solutions — to retain ownership and monetize their data, unlocking its economic potential. By improving access to decentralized data, _DIN_ overcomes siloed systems, supports AI innovation, and ensures compliance with global data regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

- 💻 **Decentralized Data**  
  Unlock new opportunities for AI development by leveraging decentralized data stores.

- 🤖 **Blockchain & AI**  
  Securely train AI models using blockchain to share model updates while protecting data and encouraging innovation.

- 💰 **Direct Rewards**  
  Earn cryptographic rewards for AI training, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for contributions.

## Our Vision

**Doctelligence** is an open-source framework driven by the principles of decentralization and community collaboration. The network itself operates without any central authority, ensuring that all processes and decisions are entirely peer-to-peer. **Doctelligence Labs** is the arm of Doctelligence that develops technologies for Decentralized AI (DecAI), serving as the commercial arm that also supports institutional side chains.

Supported by the **Doctelligence Foundation**, our mission is to empower individuals, organizations, and various sectors through transparent, decentralized AI technologies. We facilitate a decentralized ecosystem where innovation and growth are driven by the community. This ensures a fair and functional system for all participants, with no single point of control. Doctelligence seeks to aid the ongoing development of this network, helping to fuel its expansion while maintaining its open, peer-driven nature.
