The **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** is a fully decentralized protocol built for EVM-compatible blockchains. It enables secure collaboration in AI development and monetization of data through Federated Learning (FL), creating an open, transparent ecosystem for AI and data-driven markets. DIN allows AI models to be trained without relying on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers, empowering data owners and fostering self-sovereign economies.

We are proud recipients of the [Cosmos Institute Grant](https://cosmos-institute.org), supported by the University of Oxford, which helped us establish our team and advance early development.

## Empowering Sovereign Data & AI Development

DIN supports decentralized data ecosystems and self-sovereign identity networks, making it easier for data owners and AI developers to engage in trustless collaboration. It enables:

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers:** Secure data monetization while maintaining privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, participants exchange encrypted model updates, ensuring that both data sovereignty and privacy are preserved.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** The network is protected by a decentralized validator system, meaning no reliance on centralized servers or third-party intermediaries. This ensures trust and security across the ecosystem.

**Prior to recent trends that emphasize large-scale GPU-based models, it has always made both economic and research sense to prioritize smaller, more efficient models. Moore’s Law and basic economics suggest that doing more with less—at greater scale and lower cost—yields better outcomes. DIN is designed with this in mind, supporting a future where scalable, efficient AI infrastructure thrives without dependence on centralized compute.**

## Inclusive Data Economies

In traditional data economies, wealth tends to be concentrated, often leaving contributors without fair compensation. DIN changes this by enabling **inclusive and circular economies**, where data owners are rewarded with stablecoins, and AI-driven insights are reinvested into goods and services—generating value across the ecosystem.

Blockchain technology has opened new possibilities for restructuring social and economic systems. By removing intermediaries, it has enabled more inclusive, collaborative models. DIN leverages these innovations to empower individuals within data ecosystems, ensuring that value is returned to contributors, rather than extracted by centralized entities.

## Stable Infrastructure, Stablecoin Transactions

Our decentralized network is secured by **Proof of Stake validators**, ensuring stability and reliability. Our native token is not designed as a speculative asset but as a secure foundation for the infrastructure. This design enables **stablecoin transactions**—allowing developers to use stable digital currencies without facing the volatility typical of traditional cryptocurrencies.

This model offers the same stability as fiat currencies but within a decentralized framework—ensuring reliable infrastructure for both AI ecosystems and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. With stable valuation and flexible use cases, DIN offers a **future-proof foundation** for the evolving decentralized economy.

## Key Features of DIN

- **Self-Sovereign Data Ownership**  
  Control and own your data, enabling secure AI training within a decentralized infrastructure. No central authority oversees or controls your data.

- **Decentralized AI Training with Federated Learning**  
  Train AI models using Federated Learning (FL), where only encrypted updates (not raw data) are shared. This ensures privacy while facilitating collaboration among decentralized participants.

- **High-Frequency Trustless Incentives**  
  Earn stablecoin rewards directly for your participation in the network, with no intermediaries taking a cut. Trustless transactions ensure fair compensation for all contributors.

## Foundation & Governance

The **DIN Foundation** is a non-profit organization dedicated to the growth and evolution of the protocol. Like Ethereum, the network is ownerless, with no central authority controlling it. The protocol is sustained by a global community and secured by a decentralized validator network. This ensures that the ecosystem is resilient and self-sustaining, both now and in the future.
