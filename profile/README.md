# Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)

**Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** is a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Federated Learning (FL) protocol for EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure AI collaboration, privacy-first AI agent training, and data monetization. DIN powers **open AI and data marketplaces**, where models are trained **without reliance on centralized Web2.0 data silos or third-party gatekeepers**, supporting **individually owned, data-driven economies** for a **self-sovereign and agentic AI future**.

We are recipients of a **Cosmos Institute** Grant: [cosmos-institute.org](https://cosmos-institute.org/), based in Austin, Texas, and the University of Oxford.

## 🌍 Empowering Sovereign Data & Open Agentic AI Development

Our infrastructure is designed to support the development and training of **open agentic AI systems**, where **AI agents** are empowered to operate with **autonomy**, **privacy**, and **sovereignty**. This is made possible through **decentralized Federated Learning (FL)**, which allows **agents** to evolve and learn without relying on centralized servers or exposing sensitive data.

- **For Data Owners & AI Developers**: Securely **monetize data** while preserving privacy. Instead of sharing raw data, contributors exchange **model updates**, ensuring **data sovereignty** and compliance with privacy standards.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: The network is secured by **validators**, eliminating reliance on **centralized compute nodes** or third-party intermediaries, creating a truly **decentralized AI environment** for open **AI agents** to thrive.
- **Open Agentic Economy**: Users earn high-frequency **stablecoin rewards** for their contributions to the network. These rewards can then be used to access **premium AI agent services** or reinvested into the ecosystem to enable the next generation of **autonomous agents**.

## 🔑 A Unique Approach: Stable Infrastructure, Stablecoin Transactions

A core differentiator of DIN is our use of a **decentralized validator network**, secured via **Proof of Stake** and enhanced by our integration with **Eigenlayer’s Actively Validated Services (AVS) stack**. This allows us to **bootstrap validator participation** using Ethereum’s existing restaking infrastructure—bringing robust security and economic alignment from day one.

> **Our infrastructure is chain-agnostic within the Ethereum ecosystem**, meaning DIN can be seamlessly deployed across a wide array of Ethereum L2s, rollups, and sidechains. This enhances interoperability and ensures DIN can serve any blockchain solution within the Ethereum family.

Rather than acting as a speculative asset, our native token serves as the **backbone for decentralized infrastructure**, while transactions within the ecosystem are facilitated using **stablecoins**.

This model supports:

- **Stablecoin-based transactions** for developers, users, and **AI agents**  
- **Predictable costs** for AI training, data operations, and premium agent services  
- **Interoperability with Ethereum-based DeFi systems**  
- **Access to premium open agent services** through stablecoin subscriptions

Much like traditional financial systems, this design promotes:

- **Stable valuation**  
- **Market exchange compatibility**  
- **Price predictability**  

Whether using established stablecoins or experimenting with new value-pegged tokens, this architecture provides a reliable, non-volatile foundation for decentralized AI, **open agentic AI systems**, and data monetization.

## 🌱 Additional Features

### 🔗 **Eigenlayer Integration for Validator Bootstrapping**

Our validator network leverages **Eigenlayer's AVS stack**, inheriting Ethereum’s security model while remaining **chain-agnostic** across Ethereum ecosystem chains. This accelerates decentralization, compatibility, and trust from the outset.

### 🌍 **Circular Economy for Open Agentic AI**

Users and developers engage in a **circular economy**: contributors earn rewards in **stablecoins** for their data and compute contributions, which can then be used to access **premium open AI agent services**, fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem that enables autonomous, **open AI agents** to thrive.

---

## 🌐 Governance & Foundation

Like Ethereum, **no single entity owns the network**. It is sustained by a global community and secured by **decentralized validators**, now further enhanced via **Eigenlayer integration**, ensuring long-term resilience and autonomy.

*Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) Foundation* is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the protocol’s evolution through **open governance** and the promotion of **self-sovereign AI ecosystems**.
